# Prettify JSON

The script takes as an input the path to the file with arbitrary data in JSON format and displays its contents to the console in an easy-to-read format: adds line breaks, left indents and spaces.

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python pprint_json.py <path to file>
```

Example of output:

```json
{
    "features": [
        {
            "geometry": {
                "coordinates": [
                    37.39703804817934,
                    55.740999719549094
                ],
                "type": "Point"
            },

```
